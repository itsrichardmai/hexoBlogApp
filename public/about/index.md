# Hi there! I am Richard Mai

A Proud Central High School Alumni, Philadelphian, Passionate Programmer & Marketer. Raised from an Asian family, I was enstilled the importance of being humble. I believe that we, no matter our titles or situations, are and will forever be students. Especially so in the rapidly growing field of technology. In 2019, I completed the Unniversity of Pennsylannia's 24-week Coding Bootcamp. In total, I have been a developer for two years. I've decided to create a static website as an archive to store my progress.
